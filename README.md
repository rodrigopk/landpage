# Landpage

This is a small project to serve as a online CV/portfolio for myself. It uses AngularJS to render the views and Ruby on Rails to provide the data through an API.

On the project root folder:

    $ bundle install
    $ rails db:create
    $ rails db:migrate
    $ rails db:seed
    $ cd client
    $ npm install

### Running

To run the project locally, you need to start both the rails and angular servers.

### Deploying 

The project is aimed to be deployed as a single package. TO-DO: Add heroku deployment instructions.
